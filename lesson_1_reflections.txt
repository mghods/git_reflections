Q: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
A: Running diff command and viewing difference between two versons of a file helped 
me to figure out what was the problem with the application. It helped me to fix 
the code.

Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
A: It can help me to go back and figure out my thought process, find out where I made 
mistakes, go back to an earlier phase of my code and branch out from there.

Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
A: Manually commiting is error-prone since I might to forget to commit or I might have 
a hard time to commit correctly (it is based on human judgment). 
On the other hand, manual commiting gives me a great deal of freedom, 
different tasks or projects might need different commiting strategies.

Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
A: When developing an application, every files count. So all the files should be tracked.
However, in case of documents like google documents, files are usually self-sufficient and contain all information needed.

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
A: Basically you can see what you have done ingeneral (log) and in detail (diff).

q: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
A: Since you are sure you can go back in time, you are more confident to make changes.
You are not afraid of consequences anymore.

Q: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
A: Developing an app I am working on.
